In between we have a murkier situation.  One thing we could do to try to get a better understanding of this relationship is try and see how the probability of bearing varies as a function of height.  We can estimate the probability $P(\\textrm{bearing} = 1 | x )$ by looking at the empirical probability of bearing in a small neighborhood of $x$, say $$P(\\textrm{bearing} = 1 | \\textrm{height} = x ) \\approx \\frac{\\textrm{\\# samples bearing}}{\\textrm{\\# samples in }[x-0.5,x+0.5]}$$  \n",

    "## Why use the sigmoid function?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very natural to ask why we use the sigmoid function instead of some other \"S\"-shaped curve.  There are a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  There is a very nice theory of \"generlized linear models\".  In brief:\n",
    "    * We assume that the distribution $P(y | \\vec{x})$ has a particular form which fits into an \"exponential family\" of distributions (in our case the Bernoulli distributions).\n",
    "    * We specify a \"link function\" $g$ with $g(\\mathbb{E}(y | \\vec{x})) = \\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta}$ (i.e. the link of the expected value is a linear function of the predictors).\n",
    "    * In this setup we have a \"canonical link function\" (a bit technical to define).  For the Bernoulli family of distributions, $g(p) = \\log(\\frac{p}{1-p})$ is the canonical link function, and $g^{-1} = \\sigma$.\n",
    "        * The canonical link makes the calculus come out really nicely.  We saw in math hour that the gradient and hessian for logistic regression are extremely simple:  this generalizes to all generalized linear models.\n",
    "* As we have already noted, the parameters are easily interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You *could* use other link functions.  A popular choice is the inverse of the cdf of the normal distribution $\\Phi^{-1}$ which gives us \"probit regression\": we assume $\\mathbb{E}(y | \\vec{x}) = \\Phi(\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta}$).\n",
    "* This can be interpretted as assuming that our data generating process is that $y = 1$ when $\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta} + \\epsilon > 0$ and $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n",
    "* $\\Phi$ and $\\sigma$ are good approximations of each other, so the results are often quite similar.\n",
    "* Probit regression *is* preferable sometimes, such as when we want to avoid an assumption of [independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives).\n",
    "* The interpretation of the model parameters is harder.\n",
    "* The calculus of fitting the model is a lot harder (no nice closed form formulas)."

    "### Algorithm Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "While we were explaining the concept of logistic regression, we did not mention any of the assumptions of the algorithm. Let's talk about that here before we move on to real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The log odds depend linearly on the regressors.\n",
    "- The regressors are measured without error.\n",
    "- The observations are independent.\n",
    "- The data are not perfectly linearly seperable (i.e. there cannot be some vector $\\vec{v}$ with $\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{v} < 0$ for one class and $>0$ for the other class).\n",
    "    - If they are, we will have $\\vert \\beta \\vert \\to \\infty$ as we train the model.  The resulting $p_\\beta$ will approach the indicator function of the set $\\{\\vec{x}: \\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0\\}$ as we train the model.  This isn't *horrible*, but is probably better to use something like a support vector machine in this case.\n",
    "- We do not have multicollinearity of the regressors.\n",
    "    - Just as in linear regression, multicolinearity will not impact our ability to accurately predict probabilities.  It only prevents us from understanding feature importance.\n"

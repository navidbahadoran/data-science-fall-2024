When our model has access to information it shouldn't have access to we can end up confidently shipping a product which performs **worse** than random guessing. Mistakes with data leakage are one of **the most common issues** with data science projects.  This includes the final projects submitted for this boot camp!  In fact, all of the \"case studies\" we will look at here are fictionalized versions of mistakes which have happened in previous project submissions.  These kinds of mistakes can invalidate months of hard work."
